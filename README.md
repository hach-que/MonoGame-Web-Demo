MonoGame-Web-Demo
=================

This is a demo project using MonoGame on the Web (JSIL) platform.

Run `Protobuild.exe --generate Web`.

Ensure you have a web server serving up `bin\Debug` and then open `http://localhost/index.htm` (assuming that points to the `index.htm` file on disk).

Depending on the state of web platform support, you should at least see a red canvas being cleared.
